            The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India or the Men in Blue,[10][11] represents India
            in men's international cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a
            Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20
            International (T20I) status.

            Cricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by British sailors in the 18th century, and the first
            cricket club was established in 1792. India's men's national cricket team played its first international
            match on 25 June 1932 in a Lord's Test against England becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket
            status. India had to wait until 1952, almost twenty years, for its first Test victory. In its first fifty
            years of international cricket, success was limited, with only 35 wins in 196 Tests.[12] The team, however,
            gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, Kapil
            Dev, and the Indian spin quartet.

            In men's limited-overs cricket, India made its ODI and T20I debuts in 1974 and 2006, respectively. The team
            has won five major ICC tournaments, winning the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and 2011), the ICC T20 World
            Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy twice (2002 and 2013) and have also finished as runners-up in
            the World Cup once (2003), the T20 World Cup once (2014), and the Champions Trophy twice (2000 and 2017).
            The team were also part of ICC World Test Championship finals in the first two editions (2019–21, 2021–23).
            It was the second team after the West Indies to win the World Cup and the first team to win the World Cup on
            home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

            They have also won the Asia Cup seven times, in 1984, 1988, 1990–91, 1995, 2010, 2016 and 2018, whilst
            finishing runners-up thrice (1997, 2004, 2008). The team also won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket,
            defeating Pakistan in the final. Other achievements include winning the ICC Test Championship Mace five
            times and the ICC ODI Championship Shield once.

            As of June 2023, the team is ranked first in Tests, third in ODIs and first in T20Is in the ICC
            rankings.[13]

        <h2>The Fearless Captains Of ICT</h2>
        <p>
            Sourav Ganguly became the regular captain of the men's team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000.[122] He
            remained captain until 2005–06 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49
            Test matches in charge and 76 of his 146 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of
            the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. India
            lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia.
            Rahul Dravid took over as men's Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series
            victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years.
            <br>
            <br>

            In September 2007, MS Dhoni was named as the new captain of the men's ODI and Twenty20 International
            teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team
            to the inaugural World men's Twenty20 title. Anil Kumble was appointed Test captain in November 2007,
            but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded
            him as the men's Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the
            Indian men's cricket team held the number one position in the ICC Men's Test Team Rankings for 21 months
            (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine
            straight wins).[124] Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions
            Trophy. Thus, Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC
            Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC Men's T20 World Cup in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.[125]
            However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014 and Dhoni retired from Test cricket
            in December 2014, with Virat Kohli being named as the new Test captain.[126] Dhoni resigned as captain
            of the ODI and T20I teams in January 2017 and Kohli succeeded him at the position.
            <br>
            <br>

            Under Kohli's captaincy, India was unbeaten in 19 Test matches, starting from a 3–0 series win over New
            Zealand and ending with a 2–1 series win over Australia. India also had an unbeaten streak of winning 9
            consecutive Test series, starting with a 3–0 series win over Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka and ending with a
            1–0 series win over Sri Lanka at home. India also became only the third team after Australia and South
            Africa to have won their most recent Test series simultaneously against all the other Test playing
            nations. As per winning percentage in Test matches, Kohli was India's second most successful Test
            captain, behind Ajinkya Rahane, having won more than 58% of Test matches (at least 2 games).
            <br>
            <br>

            In November 2021, Rohit Sharma was appointed as the new T20I captain of the Indian men's cricket team
            after Kohli resigned from the role.[129] Kohli led India one last time in T20Is at the T20 World Cup
            2021. Under Rohit's first series as permanent captaincy, India whitewashed New Zealand at home in the
            T20I series 3–0.[130] In December 2021, Sharma was also appointed as the new ODI captain of the Indian
            men's cricket team, replacing Kohli ahead of their away series against South Africa.[131] Kohli later
            quit as Test captain as well, after their Test series loss to South Africa.[132] Sharma replaced Kohli
            as Test captain before the Test series against Sri Lanka[133] and is now the Full-Time Captain of the
            Indian men's cricket team.

        <h3>The Fascinating Jerseys Of ICT</h3>
        <p>
            The 1999 World Cup edition was held in England and attended by 12 teams from all around the globe. This
            tournament followed Super Six format in which 6 teams were divided into two groups. India finished second in
            the group, but performed very poorly in Super Six and won only one match. In the end, Australia defeated
            Pakistan in the final after a tough semifinal against South Africa.
            Jersey- The Indian jersey this time was similar to the 1996 version. However, this time the yellow colour
            was more noticeable. The diagonal yellow pattern with a black border went across the chest while the rest of
            the jersey was blue. The collar was yellow again, but the border was black.
            2003 - Blue colour Jersey with tri-colour and black sides
            <br>

        <h4>2003 world cup jersey</h4>

        </div>


        Apart from 2011 and 1983, the 2003 World Cup hosted by South Africa was one of India's most successful
        campaigns. A total of 14 teams participated, divided into two groups. The format of this world cup was similar
        to that
        of the Super Six in 1999, after the group stage. India performed very well throughout the tournament and
        advanced to the final to face Australia. However, they were easily defeated by Australia as the team won the
        title for the second consecutive year.
        Jersey- In this World Cup, the Indian jersey was a major upgrade from its predecessor and was loved by fans,
        as the word "India" was present on the chest part with a tricolour striped background. Indian jersey has
        witnessed a dramatic change, with blue becoming darker and yellow disappearing.
        2007 - Again Light Blue Jersey but totally different design and with tri-colour.

        <h4>World Cup 2007</h4>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2007.jpg?resize=680%2C382&ssl=1"

        </div>
        So far, the 2007 World Cup held in the West Indies, was India's worst World Cup ever. Despite being
        favorites at the beginning, India was overthrown by Bangladesh in the first game. They continued to lose to
        Sri Lanka and were eliminated from the tournament. This loss shocked many cricket fans who chosen India as a
        favorite that year, especially after becoming a finalist in the previous edition. India finished third in
        the group stage and did not make it to Super 8. In the final, Australia defeated Sri Lanka and claimed the
        World Cup for the third consecutive year.
        Jersey- This year the pale blue colour made a comeback in the Indian jersey. It can be said that this is
        India's neatest jersey so far on which "India" was written in bold yellow.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>2011 - The Winning Dark Blue Jersey with tri-colour</h4>
        <div class="text-center">

                height=400px;>
        </div>

        The 2011 World Cup is unforgettable for Indian fans as after a long twenty-eight years gap, India lifted the
        World Cup trophy. Team India defeated Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final to win their second title at
        Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. 14 teams participated in the game who were divided into two groups of 7 each;
        the top 4 from each group entered the quarterfinals.
        Yuvraj Singh was named "the man of the tournament" for his outstanding all-round performance. However, this
        victory is more special than other aspects. This was Sachin Tendulkar's first World Cup win after serving
        the national team for 24 years. The victory became even sweeter because it came from his hometown Mumbai.
        2011 World Cup final is also remembered for the match-winning six shot by MS Dhoni.
        Jersey - In this edition, India's jersey remained the same as previous, with only minor changes in colour
        and position. The most obvious change was the saffron colour "India" across the chest.
        2015 - Blue and Saffron Jersey made out of recycled bottles
        <br>
        <br>

        <h4>World Cup 2015</h4>
        <div class="text-center">

        Australia and New Zealand co-hosted the 2015 World Cup. Coincidentally, these two teams also qualified for
        the finals of this edition in which Australia again clinched the World Cup trophy for the fifth time and
        became five-time world champions.
        India was unbeaten in the group stage and did not lose a single match. They easily defeated Bangladesh in
        the quarterfinals but lost to Australia by 95 runs in the semifinals.
        Jersey - Sports brand Nike designed Indian team’s jersey for this World Cup using 33 recycled plastic
        bottles to raise awareness to protect the environment. The jersey was similar to the 2011 edition’s design,
        only the white border was added.

        India played their fifth and final ODI against New Zealand with the series tied at 2-2 at the ACA-VDCA
        Stadium, Vizag on 29 October, 2016. Men in Blue defeated New Zealand by 190 runs and clinched the
        series.
        Jersey- This was the first time in sports history that a team (India) wore jersey with their mothers'
        name

        England and Wales hosted the 2019 World Cup. There were ten teams in total to participate in the
        tournament. The format was similar to the 1992 format where the round-robin format was revived after 27 years.
        The
        top four teams in the semifinals were India, New Zealand, England and Australia. Throughout the game,
        India's performance was consistent, but in the semifinals, India was ousted by New Zealand. Due to the rain, the
        match lasted two days.
        Jersey - India's jersey for 2019 World Cup looked probably the smartest, with dark blue shades occupying
        most of the T-shirts and pants. The word "India" continues to appear across the chest.
